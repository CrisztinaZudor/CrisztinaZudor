## 👀 Interests
Beyond the technical, I’m someone with passions and personality — and just enough existential spice to keep things interesting:<br>
<br>
🎧 Music is my emotional Wi-Fi<br>
<br>
🌀 Powered by anime and manga: because great ideas don’t always wear suits, they sometimes wear capes and have tragic backstories.<br>
<br>
🧠 A philosopher at heart: constantly wondering if free will is just bad UX, and whether I clicked “accept all cookies” on existence by mistake.<br>
<br>
🐾 Animal lover: I fall in love at least once a day with a dog I’ll never see again.<br>
